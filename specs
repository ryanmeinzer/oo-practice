OO Practice

// instantiate class called Dog
// add in a name, age and breed
// class should have a variable with all instances of the dogs in there (array)
// have two instance methods
    1. increase age of dog and 
    2. renders html that puts dog out in p tag to index.html
// somewhere random, create a form for user to do/create all this
// have some type of birthday widget to increase the dog's age
// no backend, all JS

// ask for challenges with execution context (this, call, apply, bind, =>, closures, etc.)
